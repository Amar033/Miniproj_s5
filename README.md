# MiniProject

A new Flutter project.
<br>The task at hand is to create a music player that recognizes your emotion and then suggests a song for you.
<br>All other abilities of a music player should be included in the app.

### Reason to create this
+Spotify is unusable without premium ðŸŽ¼
+We had a mini project due.
+Seemed fun.
